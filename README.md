Let's do crimes

META STUFF 
-

Prologue/tutorial level
- character: player as protagonist 
- setting/world: 
- mission: room escape maybe, out into the exciting world of the real chapter 1? 
 
  - first room to teach basic controls/commands, such as "grab", "look", "use"
  - player uses each of these commands to solve first puzzle
  - door wasn't locked, it was just a pull-not-push, but it's too late now and player is judged by the world
  
  command list for tute level: 
  - look (fails or everything is v dark)
  - use (you have no objects)
  - ask (there is no-one in the room with you - THAT YOU KNOW OF)
  - grab (you flail wildly in the darkness, grabbing at air (you need to specify what it is you want to grab))
  
  
- Implement simplified commands, for example:
  - north = 'n'
  - south = 's'
  - look = 'l'
  - use = 'u' 
*Some abilites hidden from help menu until the user has tried them at least once*

- Map = yep

suggested slightly more fleshed out story for tutorial: 
- background story which player isn't yet aware of: player is a traveller on some kind of ship (pirate,space, anything) which has crashed and broken their helmet, which is now stuck onto their head. Their helmet is connected to a team of other travellers like them who will sometimes talk to them through their helmet and give tips or advice, like in the tutorial level. On successfully getting their helmet off, it reveals a room in their ship (player still isn't aware yet it's a ship). on leaving the ship, it reveals a new world and Level One: which I suggest is where the player gathers materials to repair their ship.

Let's do crimes

META STUFF 
-

Prologue/tutorial level
- character: player as protagonist 
- setting/world: 
- mission: room escape maybe, out into the exciting world of the real chapter 1? 
 
  - first room to teach basic controls/commands, such as "grab", "look", "use"
  - player uses each of these commands to solve first puzzle
  - door wasn't locked, it was just a pull-not-push, but it's too late now and player is judged by the world
  
  command list for tute level: 
  - look (fails or everything is v dark)
  - use (you have no objects)
  - ask (there is no-one in the room with you - THAT YOU KNOW OF)
  - grab (you flail wildly in the darkness, grabbing at air (you need to specify what it is you want to grab))
